    "Once the chunks are all embedded, we store them into a vector database. When the user types in a query, it gets embedded by the same model previously used, and a similarity search returns the closest documents from the vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technical challenge is thus, given a query vector, to quickly find the nearest neighbours of this vector in the vector database. To do this, we need to choose two things: a distance, and a search algorithm to find the nearest neighbors quickly within a database of thousands of records.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Nearest Neighbor search algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plentiful choices for the nearest neighbor search algorithm: we go with Facebook's [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), since FAISS is performant enough for most use cases, and it is well known thus widely implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Distances\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding distances, you can find a good guide [here](https://osanseviero.github.io/hackerllama/blog/posts/sentence_embeddings/#distance-between-embeddings). In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cosine similarity** computes similarity between two vectors as the cosinus of their relative angle: it allows us to compare vector directions are regardless of their magnitude. Using it requires to normalize all vectors, to rescale them into unit norm.\n",
    "- **Dot product** takes into account magnitude, with the sometimes undesirable effect that increasing a vector's length will make it more similar to all others.\n",
    "- **Euclidean distance** is the distance between the ends of vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try [this small exercise](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/clustering/similarity/check-your-understanding) to check your understanding of these concepts. But once vectors are normalized, [the choice of a specific distance does not matter much](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/which-distance-function-should-i-use).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our particular model works well with cosine similarity, so choose this distance, and we set it up both in the Embedding model, and in the `distance_strategy` argument of our FAISS index. With cosine similarity, we have to normalize our embeddings.\n",

      "1. Import the necessary modules. You can either use the `optimum` library or the `transformers` library, depending on whether you want to use the `BetterTransformer` API or the standard `Pipeline` class provided by Hugging Face Transformers. Here's an example using `optimum`:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import optimum\n",
      "from optimum.pipelines import pipeline\n",
      "```\n",

      "Or using `transformers`:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import transformers\n",
      "from transformers import pipeline\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Instantiate the pipeline object with the desired task and pretrained model. For example, to create a pipeline for the `fill-mask` task using the `distilbert-base-uncased` model, you can use:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "pipe = pipeline(\"fill-mask\", \"distilbert-base-uncased\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, you can provide the model and tokenizer directly, as shown in the context:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n",
      "\n",
      "model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"gpt2-large\", torch_dtype=torch.float16)\n",
      "tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"gpt2-large\")\n",
      "\n",
      "pipe = pipeline(\"fill-mask\", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Use the pipeline object to perform inference on input data. The `__call__` method takes the input data as argument and returns the output predictions:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "input_data = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" predictions = pipe(input_data)\n",
      "print(predictions)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "That's it! You now have a pipeline object that can be used for inference on the specified task. Note that pipelines are intended for inference only, and should not be used for training or complex workflows. For more advanced use cases, you may want to consider alternative libraries like InvokeAI, Diffuzers, or lama-cleaner, as mentioned in the context.\n"
